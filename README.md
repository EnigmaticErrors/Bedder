## Motive
In 2021 Q1, during the second wave of COVID-19, there was a massive bed shortage. This led to the creation of https://tncovidbeds.tnega.org/. However, this did not provide the locations of the hospitals themselves. Our project fixes this by providing an intuitive and user-friendly UI to navigate and find beds across various districts in TN.

## Scope for improvement
Currently Bedder only works for the TN state. We aim to expand this to other Indian states as well. We also aim to plot the currently unplotted points by using google reverse geolocation API.
